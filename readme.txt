= 1.2.6 =
* Commented out filters on "woocommerce_order_status_pending" and "woocommerce_order_status_processing" hooks. This keeps PMPro from removing a user's membership level when they are renewing which can cause issues. (Thanks, Trisha Cupra and others.)

* WooCommerce now mimics PMPro checkout, creating a custom level array instead of passing the ID. So if your level has an expiration number and period, it will be used when adding the level to the user checking out in WooCommerce... i.e. expiration dates "work" now. You can filter the level information using the pmprowoo_checkout_level filter.
* Added pmprowoo_checkout_level filter to allow filtering the checkout level (to use PMPro expiration dates, etc. if Subscriptions addon is not installed)

= 1.2.1 =
* Fixed updating of WooCommerce billing address user meta when brand new users checkout with PMPro.

= 1.2 =
* Updating user meta for billing address when the Woo Commerce billing address is updated and vice versa.

* Added code to force account creation at checkout if the cart includes a membership level.

* Added membership discounts
* Moved PMPro options to separate tab

= .2 =
